Title: Compare K-nearest neighbors of one biaxial plot to another

Maintainer: Tyler Burns <info@burnslsc.com>
Description: Built off of the sleepwalk package for single-cell data, 
  KnnSleepwalk allows the user to take two or more plots, and compare the 
  K-nearest neighbors (KNN) of one to the KNN of the other. The common use case
  is to take two UMAPs, and display the KNN of UMAP space on one, and the KNN
  of the original high-dimensional space on the other.
